# Enigma

### Self Evaluation

#### Functionality - 3
  * I gave myself this score because in my `Enigma` class I was able to create functioning `encrypt` and `decrypt` methods. The `encrypt` method is capable of taking an optional argument for the key, if none is provided it will default to a random five digit number. Both methods can take an optional argument for the date, which will default to todays date. I was also able to successfully implement the CLI for both encrypting and decrypting a message.

#### OOP - 3
  * I gave myself this score because all of my classes are clear and each of the methods are only performing one action. I utilized helper methods as best as I could in order to keep the length of my methods relatively short. One area I could have improved on was creating more descriptive method names(naming is so hard!). I feel my methods reflect data structures that I have learned throughout my time at Turing so far and I did my best to use the most appropriate enumerable depending on the situation.

#### TTD - 3
  * I gave myself this score because I was able to stick to proper TTD practice by writing my tests first and then creating my methods from there. I did find it difficult to test every part of certain methods however my coverage does show that I am at 100%. I was also able to include a few mocks and stubs when testing data that had an element of randomness.
